ReST: Representational State Transfer
	-usapin ng state: how can I represent that I'm getting/deleting a state etc
ReST Components:
1. HTTP Verbs: yung ginagawa
	-Post: to create a resource
	-Put: to update an existing resource
	-Get: retrieve a resource
	-Delete: delete a resource
2. Resource path: asan ko ba makukuha, san ko madedelete, san ako pwede mag add ng resource
3. Header: anong format ng body niya; there are different types, but we use application-json
4. Body: json is a key-value pair, comma-separated, inside curly braces, etc
5. Response: may response code (numbers e.g. 404) and a body (pero body is optional)
	1xx: continuing
	200, 200: OK, Created (basta successful)
	400, 404, 405: bad request, not found, not allowed
	500: internal server error

To test with exceptions:
1. POST: if u enter an existing username/email, dapat mag 400
2. GET: if u get a non-existing id, dapat mag 404
3. PUT: if u try to change to an existing username/email, will give 400; if you try to change a non-existing id, 404
4. DELETE: if u try to delete a non-existing id, 404; NOTE: different from the 204 you get after a successful deletion
